# Animation Project #1

#### ELEMENTS SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED:
1) Use real time so sync animations (implemented in the render function)
2) Ground box is placed at the bottom of the window as described
3) Placed 2 rocks of varying size on the ground box, centered horizontally
4) Seaweed models have 10 ellipses each
5) [SEE PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED]
6) Seaweed positioning: there are three strands with the center strand placed a bit higher to provide variation
7) Fish model has all parts listed, body, head, tail, eyes
8) Fish swims around the seaweed and follows/rotates with the tangent of the circle
9) Human model with a head, body, legs, feet, and no arms
10) Human moves in the x and y world directions as required
11) [SEE PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED]
12) Scene and all parts fit within the 512x512 window

#### ELEMENTS PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED:
6) Seaweed animation does not match the example video, I tried using the cosine equation provided in the hints and messed around with the values before running out of time/moving on as the strands would not oscillate like they do in the example for me, instead they stay in a straight line and the individual ellipses are affected by the translation

11) The legs of the character do kick back and forth but I had issues with setting the rotation points of the upper and lower legs to match and they are not perfectly attached at the knee joint so there is a small error there

## Playing the Animation

To view the animation simply open `main.html` in Chrome or Firefox.
